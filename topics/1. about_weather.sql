I experience distinct weather changes throughout the day. Let me explain.

In the morning, the sun shines brightly, providing a healthy dose of vitamin D. A mild and pleasant breeze makes this time
especially enjoyable.
However, by 9 AM, the sun begins to feel more intense as it climbs higher in the sky, heralding a sunny and warm day ahead.

In the afternoon, the temperature outside becomes uncomfortably hot, making it difficult to spend time outdoors. Inside, however, 
the temperature remains bearable, thanks to the natural airflow in the room, as I dont use fans or any other electrical equipment.

As evening approaches, the sun sets, and it starts to get a bit darker. The wind picks up, creating a cooler environment. 
Its advisable to wear a jacket during this time to avoid catching a cold.

At night, the darkness is complete, and the sky is adorned with stars. The wind continues to be gentle and refreshing, 
perfect for enjoying the serene mountain night.

This is a day in my life, marked by the natural shifts in mountain weather.
