### Key Points:
- ** Use of "have" and "has"**:
   "Have" is used with "I," "you," "we," and "they," while 
   "has" is used with "he," "she," and "it."

- **Past Participle**: This is a form of the verb that is used in perfect tenses.
   Regular verbs form their past participle by adding "-ed" to the base form (e.g., "walked," "cleaned"), 
   whereas irregular verbs can have various past participle forms (e.g., "gone," "eaten," "been").

- **Time Reference**: The present perfect tense does not specify when the action occurred; 
it only indicates that the action is relevant to the present moment. Words like "already," "yet," "just," 
"ever," and "never" are often used with the present perfect to provide more information about the timing or
 frequency of the action.

This tense can be a bit tricky because it doesnt have a direct equivalent in some other languages, 
so it often requires practice to use correctly and naturally.
