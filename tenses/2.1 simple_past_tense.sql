### 1. Affirmative (Positive) Statements

For **regular verbs**, you typically add **-ed** to the base form of the verb. If the verb already ends 
in **e**, you just add **-d**.

- **Talk** → **talked**
- **Love** → **loved**

For **irregular verbs**, there is no specific rule, and the simple past forms must be memorized as they can 
vary widely.

- **Go** → **went**
- **Eat** → **ate**

### 2. Negative Statements
To form the negative in the simple past tense, 
you use **did not** (or the contraction **didnt**) followed by the base form of the verb. 
This is the same for both regular and irregular verbs.

- **Talk** → **did not talk / didnt talk**
- **Go** → **did not go / didnt go**

### 3. Interrogative (Questions)
To ask a question in the simple past tense, you start with **did**, followed by the subject, and 
then the base form of the verb. Again, this applies to both regular and irregular verbs.

- **Talk** → **Did you talk...?**
- **Go** → **Did you go...?**

### Rules to Remember

1. **Regular verbs** typically add **-ed** to form the past tense.
2. **Irregular verbs** have unique past tense forms that often need to be memorized.
3. For **negative** statements, use **did not** or **didnt** plus the base form of the verb.
4. To form **questions**, start with **did**, then the subject, followed by the base form of the verb.

Understanding these rules can help you correctly use the simple past tense in various sentence structures.
