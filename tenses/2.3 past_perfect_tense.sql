############## 2.3 PAST PERFECT TENSE #############

# SUBJECT +  HAD + VERB3(PAST PARTICIPLE) ###########
The past perfect tense is used to express an action that was completed before another action took place in 
the past. Its often used to highlight the order of events or to show cause and effect. 
Heres a breakdown of how to form and use the past perfect tense, including affirmative, negative, and 
interrogative sentences:

######### 1. Formation: ###########
The past perfect tense is formed using the auxiliary verb "had" followed by the past participle of the main verb.

- **Affirmative**: Subject + had + past participle (e.g., "She had finished her work.")
- **Negative**: Subject + had + not + past participle (e.g., "She had not finished her work.")
- **Interrogative**: Had + subject + past participle? (e.g., "Had she finished her work?")

### 2. Rules and Usage:

#### Affirmative Sentences:
- Use to express an action completed before another action or time in the past.
- Example: "By the time you called, I had already left."

#### Negative Sentences:
- Use to express that an action was not completed before a specific time or another action in the past.
- Example: "He hadn't seen the movie before, so we decided to watch it."

#### Interrogative Sentences:
- Use to ask if an action was completed before another action or time in the past.
- Example: "Had you ever visited the museum before it closed?"

### 3. Key Points:

- The past participle is the third form of the verb. For regular verbs, its formed by adding -ed to the base 
form (e.g., "talked"), but many common verbs are irregular (e.g., "gone," "seen").

- The past perfect is often used with time expressions such as "before," "by the time," "already," "never," 
and "after."
- Its helpful to contrast the past perfect with the simple past, which describes actions that happened in 
the past but doesnt emphasize the sequence or relationship between those actions.

Understanding and correctly using the past perfect tense can greatly improve the clarity and precision of your 
writing, especially when discussing sequences of events or conditions in the past.
