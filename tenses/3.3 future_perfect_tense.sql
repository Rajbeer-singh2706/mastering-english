######## 3.3 FUTURE PERFECT TENSE #################

# SUBJECT + WILL HAVE + PAST PARTICIPLE ( V3 )

The future perfect tense in English is used to express actions that will have been completed by a 
certain point in the future. Its formed by using the future simple of the verb "to have" (will have) 
followed by the past participle of the main verb. Here are the rules for forming sentences in the future 
perfect tense, including affirmative, negative, and interrogative (question) forms:

##################### 1. Affirmative Form #####################
To construct an affirmative sentence in the future perfect tense, follow this structure:
- **Subject** + will have + **Past Participle** of the main verb.

**Example:** 
- "She **will have finished** her project by next Monday."

##################### 2. Negative Form #####################
To make a sentence negative in the future perfect tense, you include "not" between "will" and "have":
- **Subject** + will not (wont) have + **Past Participle** of the main verb.

**Example:** 
- "They **will not have returned** from their vacation by then."

##################### 3. Interrogative Form #####################
For asking questions in the future perfect tense, invert "will" and the subject, 
and follow with "have" and the past participle of the main verb:
- Will + **Subject** + have + **Past Participle** of the main verb?

**Example:** 
- "Will you have reached your goal by the end of the year?"

##################### Rules and Usage #####################
* The future perfect tense is particularly useful for expressing actions that will be completed before 
some other point or action in the future.
* The past participle of regular verbs is formed by adding "-ed" to the base form, whereas irregular verbs 
have unique past participle forms that must be memorized (e.g., gone, seen, made).

* Time expressions such as "by tomorrow," "by next week," "by the end of the year," etc., are commonly used
with the future perfect tense to indicate the future point in time by which the action will have been completed.

Remember, the future perfect tense is not as commonly used as other tenses in English, but its very useful
for specific contexts where you need to emphasize the completion of an action relative to another point in 
time in the future.
