######### 3.2 FUTURE CONTINUOUS TENSE #######
The future continuous tense, also known as the future progressive tense, is used to indicate that an action
will be occurring at a specific time in the future. It often suggests that the action will be in progress 
at a certain point in time. This tense is formed using the auxiliary verbs "will be" followed by the 
present participle of the main verb (verb+ing).

Here are the rules for forming sentences in the future continuous tense, including affirmative, negative, 
and interrogative forms:

### Affirmative Form
The structure for the affirmative form is:
- **Subject + will be + present participle (verb+ing)**

Example:
- "She will be working at 8 o'clock tomorrow."

################# Negative Form #################
To form a negative sentence in the future continuous tense, you simply add "not" after "will":
- **Subject + will not (wont) be + present participle (verb+ing)**

Example:
- "They will not (won't) be attending the meeting tomorrow."

################# Interrogative Form #################
To ask a question using the future continuous tense, invert the subject and "will":
- **Will + subject + be + present participle (verb+ing)?**

Example:
- "Will you be using the computer tonight?"

#################### Special Notes: #################
* The future continuous can express a polite inquiry about someones plans without demanding a direct answer.
* Its also used for predictions about ongoing actions in the future.
* Another use is to refer to future events that are fixed or decided.

Remember, the context in which you use the future continuous tense can alter its meaning slightly, 
especially in terms of politeness, assumptions, or predictions about the future.
