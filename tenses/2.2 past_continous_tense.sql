############### 2.2 PAST CONTINOUS TENSE ########### 
The past continuous tense, also known as the past progressive tense, is used to indicate that an action was
ongoing at a certain point in the past. This tense is formed by combining the past tense of the verb 
"to be" (was/were) with the present participle (verb ending in -ing) of the main verb. 
Heres a breakdown of how to form affirmative, negative, and interrogative sentences in the 
past continuous tense:

### Affirmative Sentences
**Structure:** Subject + was/were + present participle (verb-ing)

- **Examples:**
  - I **was reading** a book.
  - You **were watching** TV.
  - They **were playing** football.

### Negative Sentences
**Structure:** Subject + was/were + not + present participle (verb-ing)

- **Examples:**
  - I **was not reading** a book.
  - You **were not watching** TV.
  - They **were not playing** football.

### Interrogative Sentences
**Structure:** Was/Were + subject + present participle (verb-ing)?

- **Examples:**
  - **Was** I **reading** a book?
  - **Were** you **watching** TV?
  - **Were** they **playing** football?

### Rules and Usage
1. **When to Use**: The past continuous tense is used for actions that were in progress at a specific time in 
the past. It often sets the scene in narratives to describe what was happening around a particular event.

2. **Interrupted Actions**: It can be used to indicate that an action in the past was interrupted by another 
action. The interrupted action is in the past continuous, while the interrupting action is usually in the simple past. 
- Example: I **was reading** when the phone **rang**.

3. **Parallel Actions**: To describe two or more actions that were happening at the same time in the past,
the past continuous tense is used.
   - Example: I **was cooking** while he **was cleaning** the kitchen.

4. **With "While" and "When"**: "While" is often used with the past continuous to indicate that an action
 was happening at the same time as another action. "When" is used to introduce an action that interrupts the action in the past continuous.
   - Example with "while": While I **was walking** home, I **was listening** to music.
   - Example with "when": I **was walking** home when I **met** an old friend.

# Remember, the choice between "was" and "were" depends on the subject (I/he/she/it was, you/we/they were).
