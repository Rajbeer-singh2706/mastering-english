* The negative form "will not" can be contracted to "won't."
* Questions in the simple future tense are formed by inverting the subject and "will."
* For predictions, decisions made at the moment of speaking, promises, offers, and actions decided 
before speaking, use the simple future tense.

By keeping these rules in mind, you can effectively use the simple future tense in English to talk about 
future events or actions.
