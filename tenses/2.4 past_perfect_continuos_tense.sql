############## 2.4 PAST PERFECT CONTINOUS TENSE #############

# SUBJECT +  HAD + BEEN + (PRESENT PARTICIPLE ) + ING   ###########
The Past Perfect Continuous tense is used to describe an action that began in the past and continued up to a 
certain point in the past. It emphasizes the duration of the action. This tense is formed by using "had been" 
followed by the present participle of the verb (verb-ing).

Here are the rules and examples for forming sentences in the Past Perfect Continuous tense, 
covering affirmative, negative, and interrogative forms:

########## 1. Affirmative (Positive) Form ################
**Structure**: Subject + had been + present participle (verb-ing)

**Example**: "She had been waiting for the bus for an hour before it finally arrived."

In this example, the action of waiting started in the past and continued until the bus arrived.

############ 2. Negative Form #####################
**Structure**: Subject + had not been + present participle (verb-ing)
**Example**: "They had not been living there long when the incident occurred."

This sentence suggests that their living there started in the past and was of short duration 
when the incident happened.

################## 3. Interrogative (Question) Form #####################
**Structure**: Had + subject + been + present participle (verb-ing)?

**Example**: "Had you been studying all night before the test?"

This question implies that the studying began in the past and continued until the test, and it seeks to 
confirm that action.

### Key Points to Remember
**Duration**: The Past Perfect Continuous often focuses on the duration of the action. It is common to use 
time expressions such as "for two weeks," "since Friday," "all day," "all night," etc.

**Temporary Actions**: It is used for actions that were temporary, not permanent, and had clear beginning and
ending points in the past.
  
**Cause of Something in the Past**: This tense can also be used to show the cause of something in the past. 
For example, "He was tired because he had been running."

Remembering these rules and structure will help you correctly use the Past Perfect Continuous tense in 
different types of sentences.
