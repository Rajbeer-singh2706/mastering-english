The Present Perfect Continuous tense is used to describe actions or situations that began in the past and 
are still continuing up to the present moment, or that have recently stopped and have a connection to the
present. This tense emphasizes the duration or ongoing nature of an action.


Form: Subject + have/has + been + Verb+ing
● Use:
    ○ To describe actions that started in the past and continue into the
present.
    ○ To emphasize the duration of an action.
    ● Examples:
        ○ She has been working at the company for five years.
        ○ I have been studying English for two hours.
        ○ They have been waiting for the bus since morning.

### Structure
The structure for the Present Perfect Continuous tense varies depending on whether the sentence is
affirmative (positive), negative, or interrogative (question).

#### 1. Affirmative (Positive) Structure:

- **Formula**: Subject + has/have + been + present participle (verb+ing)
- **Example**: "She has been reading for two hours."

#### 2. Negative Structure:
- **Formula**: Subject + has/have + not + been + present participle (verb+ing)
- **Example**: "They have not been working on the project lately."

#### 3. Interrogative (Question) Structure:
- **Formula**: Has/Have + subject + been + present participle (verb+ing)?
- **Example**: "Have you been feeling better?"

### Rules
1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Use "has" with third-person singular subjects 
 (he, she, it, and singular nouns) and "have" with "I", "you", "we", "they", and plural nouns.

2. **Duration of Action**: It is common to use time expressions such as "for two hours", 
"since Monday", "all day", "lately", to indicate the duration or the starting point of the action.

3. **Temporary Situations**: This tense is often used for actions or situations that are temporary or
 expected to change.

4. **Emphasizing Duration**: The Present Perfect Continuous is used to emphasize how long an action 
has been happening, not just the fact that it has happened.

5. **Recent Completion**: It can be used for actions that have recently stopped but still have an effect 
on the present.

Remember, the Present Perfect Continuous tense is not used with stative verbs (verbs that describe states rather than actions, such as "know", "believe", "belong"). In such cases, the Present Perfect tense is used instead.
