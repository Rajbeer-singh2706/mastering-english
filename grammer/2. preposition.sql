########################## PREPOSITION ##########################
A preposition is a word that typically precedes a noun or pronoun (the object) to express a relation to another 
word or element in the clause. Prepositions can indicate various relationships, including location, direction, 
time, cause, manner, and amount. They help to provide context in sentences, clarifying how different parts 
relate to each other.

fact that their application doesnt always follow a straightforward rule. The meaning of a preposition often
 depends on the context in which it's used.
