##################### MODALS ###################
English modals, also known as modal verbs, are auxiliary verbs that express necessity, possibility, 
permission, or ability. They are an essential part of English grammar, providing additional information
about the main verb in a sentence without changing its basic meaning. Heres an overview of the primary 
English modals, including examples to illustrate their use:

1. **Can / Could**
   - **Can** is used to express ability, possibility, or ask for or give permission.
     - E.g., "I can speak three languages."
     - E.g., "Can I leave early today?"
   - **Could** is the past tense form of "can" and is used for possibility or to make polite requests.
     - E.g., "I could help you with that tomorrow."
     - E.g., "Could you pass the salt, please?"

2. **May / Might**
   - **May** is used to express possibility or ask for permission in a formal context.
     - E.g., "It may rain later."
     - E.g., "May I use your phone?"
   - **Might** is used to express a slight possibility or hypothetical situations.
     - E.g., "I might go to the party if I finish my work."

3. **Will / Would**
   - **Will** is used to express future actions or a strong intention.
     - E.g., "I will finish the report by tomorrow."
   - **Would** is the past tense form of "will" and is used for hypothetical situations or polite requests.
     - E.g., "I would go if I were you."
     - E.g., "Would you like some coffee?"

4. **Shall**
   - **Shall** is used to offer, suggest, or ask for advice, mostly in British English.
     - E.g., "Shall we dance?"

5. **Should**
   - **Should** is used to give advice or to suggest that something is a good idea.
     - E.g., "You should check that document before submitting it."

6. **Must**
   - **Must** is used to express obligation or necessity, or to indicate a strong likelihood.
     - E.g., "You must wear a seatbelt while driving."
     - E.g., "This must be the right address."

7. **Ought to**
   - Similar to "should," it is used to give advice or suggest a course of action.
     - E.g., "You ought to apologize for what you said."

Modal verbs are unique in that they do not change form according to the subject (e.g., no "s" for the third 
person singular) and are followed directly by the base form of the verb (e.g., "She can swim" not 
"She can swims"). Understanding and using modals correctly can significantly enhance your English 
communication skills.
