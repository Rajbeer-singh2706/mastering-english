
############### CONJUCTION ############
A conjunction is a part of speech used to connect words, phrases, clauses, or sentences. Conjunctions serve to 
coordinate or link different parts of a sentence to make it more coherent and to indicate the relationship 
between them. There are three main types of conjunctions:

#### 1. **Coordinating Conjunctions:** 
These connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal rank. The most 
common coordinating conjunctions are "for," "and," "nor," "but," "or," "yet," and "so," often remembered by 
the acronym FANBOYS. For example, in the sentence "She likes apples and oranges," 
"and" is a coordinating conjunction connecting "apples" and "oranges."


#### 2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** 
These connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, indicating a relationship such as time, cause and 
effect, condition, or contrast. Examples include "because," "although," "while," "since," "if," and "after." 
For instance, in the sentence "I will go out if it stops raining," "if" is a subordinating conjunction.

####### 3. **Correlative Conjunctions:** 
These work in pairs to connect equal elements in a sentence. Common pairs include "both...and," "either...or," 
"neither...nor," "not only...but also," and "whether...or." An example is the sentence 
"Both the cat and the dog were sleeping," where "both" and "and" work together as correlative conjunctions.

Conjunctions are essential for constructing complex sentences and conveying the relationship between different 
parts of a sentence, making communication clearer and more nuanced.

Certainly! Here are examples for each type of conjunction to illustrate their use in sentences:

####### Coordinating Conjunctions ######
- **For:** "I will go to the park, for I need some fresh air."
- **And:** "She bought apples and oranges from the market."
- **Nor:** "He neither called nor texted me back."
- **But:** "I wanted to go swimming, but the pool was closed."
- **Or:** "Would you like tea or coffee?"
- **Yet:** "It was raining, yet we decided to go for a walk."
- **So:** "It was late, so we decided to head home."

### Subordinating Conjunctions
- **Because:** "She was late because her alarm didn't go off."
- **Although:** "Although it was cold, they decided to go out."
- **While:** "While I read, my brother watches TV."
- **Since:** "Since we were in the area, we decided to visit."
- **If:** "If it rains, we will cancel the picnic."
- **After:** "After the movie, we went out for dinner."

### Correlative Conjunctions
- **Both...and:** "Both the cat and the dog need to be fed."
- **Either...or:** "You can either stay here or come with us."
- **Neither...nor:** "She likes neither tea nor coffee."
- **Not only...but also:** "He is not only intelligent but also very kind."
- **Whether...or:** "I couldnâ€™t decide whether to wear the red dress or the blue one."

These examples demonstrate how conjunctions link parts of sentences together to express various relationships 
like choice, reason, time, and contrast, enhancing the clarity and complexity of communication.
