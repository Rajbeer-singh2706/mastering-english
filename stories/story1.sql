######### VERSION 2 ########
One evening, I needed to visit my village. I boarded a bus, which was densely packed inside, forcing many passengers to climb onto 
the roof. Faced with this uncomfortable situation, I disembarked.
Numerous autorickshaws were available, and I inquired with several drivers about reaching my village. Despite their familiarity with 
the location, they demanded exorbitant fares, prompting me to walk instead.
As I made my way toward the village, I encountered many familiar faces from my community. They expressed curiosity about my city life
and asked about my familys well-being.
Excitement surged within me as I approached my village, eager to reconnect with my relatives. They received me with open arms, 
offering tea and snacks as a warm welcome.
After savoring the refreshments, I ventured out to reunite with my childhood friends. We engaged in lively conversations, 
sharing updates about our lives.
