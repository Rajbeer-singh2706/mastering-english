##### RULES ###
HE/SHE/IT => HAS     => SINGULAR 
I/WE/YOU/THEY => HAVE => PRULAL 


##

Always base your choice of "has" or "have" on whether the subject acts as a single entity or a collective group. 
This approach will guide you correctly in most case


Singular Names: Use "has"
If the name refers to one person or a singular entity, use "has".
Example: "Emily has traveled to Japan."
Plural Names: Use "have"
If the name refers to more than one person or a group, use "have".
Example: "The Smiths have traveled to Japan."

The words "for" and "since" are both used with the present perfect tense to indicate the duration or starting point of an action, 
but they are used in different contexts:

### For
- **Usage**: "For" is used to specify the duration of time that an action has been happening. It refers to a period of time.
- **Example**: "I have lived here for five years." (This indicates the action has been ongoing for a period of five years.)

### Since
- **Usage**: "Since" is used to indicate the starting point of an action or a state that continues to the present. It refers to a 
specific point in time when the action began.
- **Example**: "I have lived here since 2015." (This specifies the year the action started and implies it has continued up to now.)

**Key Points to Remember**:
- **"For"** is used with a period of time (e.g., two hours, three weeks, several years).
- **"Since"** is used with a specific point in time (e.g., 9 AM, last week, January, 2003, I was a child).

These distinctions help in accurately describing the duration or origin of actions, particularly when using the present perfect tense.
